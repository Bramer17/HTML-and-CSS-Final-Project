                <p>Sit in Easy Pose, shins crossed with your right shin in front. Come into a slight forward bend.

            <summary>Standing Foward Bend (Uttanasana)</summary>
            <p>When in Standing Forward Bend, use your front thigh muscles to actively pull your kneecaps up toward your hips. 
            With your fingers interlaced and your arms behind your back, lift your arms any amount away from your back. 
            Hold for 5 breaths, then change the interlace by putting the other index finger on top and stay for another 5 breaths. 
            Take your hands to your hips, and your thumbs to the top of your behind. Drop the flesh of your buttocks to the floor to propel you up to stand. 
            Take a giant step out to the right.</p> <cite>Colleen Saidman Yee</cite>

        <details style="font-size:2em;">
            <summary>Wide-Legged standing forward Bend (Prasarita Padottanasana)</summary>
            <p>Turn your feet parallel to each other and place your hands on your hips. Inhale, lift your chest, and with an exhale, bend forward from your hip joints to come into a forward bend. 
            Place your hands on the floor, shoulder-distance apart, fingers in line with your toes. Release your head toward the floor. If your head doesn't reach the floor, you can place it on a block.
            Hold the pose for 10 breaths. Inhale, come to a flat back, take your hands to your hips, and drop the flesh of your buttocks to come to stand. Heel-toe your feet together and step to the front of your mat to transition into Childâ€™s Pose.
            Take your knees to the floor, sit on your heels, and fold forward with your head on the floor.</p> <cite>Colleen Saidman Yee</cite>

        <details style="font-size:2em;">
            <summary>Rabbit Pose (Sasangasana)</summary>
            <p>From Child's Pose, interlace your fingers behind your back, lift your hips, and roll to the crown of your head. Keep pressing the tops of your feet down, so that you can control the amount of weight on your head. 
            Take your hands any amount away from your back. Lower down, change the interlace, lift your hips, and roll to the crown of head again. Lift and lower 3 times on each side, changing the interlace each time.
            Create a rhythm with the breath and movement.</p> <cite>Colleen Saidman Yee</cite>

        <details style="font-size:2em;">
            <summary>Thunderbolt Pose (Vajrasana) with eagle arms</summary>
            <p>Kneel and sit back on your heels. For Eagle arms, bend your elbows and bring the right elbow into the left, with the backs of your hands facing each other. 
            Then pass your right hand in front of your left and bring the palms together, thumbs pointing toward the tips of your nose (grab your wrist if you can't press your palms together).
            Hold for 5 breaths, then reverse your arms and hold for 5 breaths.</p> <cite>Colleen Saidman Yee</cite>

        <details style="font-size:2em;">
            <summary>Side Stretch</summary>
            <p>Take one hand to floor, walk it away from the body, and drop your head to your ear, with your other arm over your head. Repeat on the other side.</p>

        <details style="font-size:2em;">
            <summary>Plow Pose (Halasana)</summary>
            <p>Lie down with your head on the mat. Swing your legs back and over your head and rest your toes on the floor. Stay for 10 breaths. 
            Slowly roll out of Plow, keeping your head back so it doesn't whiplash forward when the legs and torso touch down.</p>
